# MEL101: Engineering Graphics & Design

## Course Objectives
* Understand the basics of engineering drawing and the fundamental principles involved in the design of engineering components.
* Develop the ability to correctly interpret and apply different scaling techniques to engineering designs and drawings.
* Master the skill of generating and interpreting different standard views (orthographic projections) of any three-dimensional object.
* Understand the methods used to represent and analyze the detailed construction and assembly of complex engineering objects.
* Learn the basic concepts and techniques involved in sheet metal fabrication and pattern development.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Student will able to understand basics of drawing and design of engineering components.
* **CO 2:** Student will able to understand scaling of designs.
* **CO 3:** Student will able to understand the different view of any object. 
* **CO 4:** Student will able to understand detail construction of any object.
* **CO 5:** Student will able to understand sheet metal work. 

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Orthographic Projection)
