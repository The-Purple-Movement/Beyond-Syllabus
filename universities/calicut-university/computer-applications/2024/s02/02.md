# BCA2CJ102: Statistical Foundation for Computer Applications

## Course Objectives
The course on probability and statistics covers fundamental topics including descriptive statistics (measures of central tendency and dispersion), probability theory (events, sample spaces, probability laws, random variables, and distributions), inferential statistics (regression analysis), and applications in various fields such as science, engineering, economics, and social sciences, emphasizing critical thinking, data analysis, and problem-solving skills.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Apply fundamental statistics concepts
* **CO2:** Analyze data using descriptive statistics
* **CO3:** Perform regression analysis
* **CO4:** Apply probability and statistics in real-world situations
* **CO5:** Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills
* **CO6:** Communicate statistical findings effectively
