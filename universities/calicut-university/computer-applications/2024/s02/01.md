# BCA2CJ101: Fundamentals of Programming (C Language)

## Course Objectives
The objectives of this course are to make the student understand programming language, programming concepts, loops, reading data, stepwise refinement, functions, control structures, arrays, structures, unions, and pointers. After completion of this course, the student is expected to be able to analyze real-life problems and write a program in the C language to solve them. The main emphasis will be on the problem-solving aspect, i.e., developing proper algorithms.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Remember the program structure of C with its syntax and semantics.
* **CO2:** Use the various constructs of a programming language, viz. conditional, iteration, and recursion.
* **CO3:** Implement algorithms in the C language.
* **CO4:** Use simple data structures like arrays in solving problems.
* **CO5:** Handle pointers and memory management functions in C.
* **CO6:** Develop efficient programs for solving a problem.

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction to C Language
* History of C, Importance of C, and sample programs.
* Character set, Tokens, Constants, Variables, and Data types.
* Operators - Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Assignment, Increment, Decrement, Conditional, Bitwise, and Special operators.
* Arithmetic expressions, operator precedence, type conversions, and mathematical functions.
* Managing Input and Output Operators: Reading and writing a character, formatted input, and formatted output.

### Module 2: Decision Making, Branching, and Looping
* Decision making with If - simple If, If else, nested If else, If else ladder.
* Switch statement, conditional operator, Goto statement.
* Loops: while, do while, for statements and nested loops.
* Jumps in loops – break, continue.

### Module 3: Arrays and Functions
* One dimensional array – declaration, initialization and accessing.
* Two-dimensional array – declaration, initialization and accessing.
* Multi dimensional array, dynamic array.
* Strings – Reading, Writing. Arithmetic operations on characters, Comparisons and string handling functions.
* Functions – Need, Elements of user defined functions and definition.
* Return values and their types, function call and declaration, call by value and call by reference.
* Categories of functions, Nesting of functions.
* Recursion and command line arguments.
* Passing arrays to functions and passing strings to functions.

### Module 4: Storage Classes, Structures, Unions, and Pointers
* Storage classes – The scope, visibility and lifetime of variables. Auto, Extern, Static and Register storage classes. Storage classes in a single source file and multiple source files.
* Structure and Union - Defining, giving values to members, initialization and comparison of structure variables, arrays of structure, arrays within structures, structures within structures, structures and functions, unions.
* Pointers definition, declaring and initializing pointers, accessing a variable through address and through pointer, pointer expressions, pointer increments and scale factor.
* Pointers and arrays, pointers and functions, pointers and structure.
* Dynamic memory allocation and memory management functions.

### Module 5: Hands-on Problem-Solving Using C, Practical Applications, Case Study and Course Project
Implement the following:
* **Variables, Data types, Constants and Operators:**
    * Evaluation of expression ex: ((x+y)^2 \* (x+z))/w
    * Temperature conversion problem (Fahrenheit to Celsius)
    * Program to convert days to months and days (Ex: 364 days = 12 months and 4 days)
    * Salesman salary (Given: Basic Salary, Bonus for every item sold, commission on the total monthly sales)
* **Decision making (Branch / Loop) Statements:**
    * Solution of quadratic equation
    * Maximum of three numbers
    * Calculate Square root of five numbers (using goto statement)
    * Pay-Bill Calculation for different levels of employee (Switch statement)
    * Fibonacci series
    * Armstrong numbers
    * Pascal 's Triangle
* **Arrays, Functions, and Strings:**
    * Prime numbers in an array
    * Sorting data (Ascending and Descending)
    * Matrix Addition and Subtraction
    * Matrix Multiplication
    * Transpose of a matrix
    * Function with no arguments and no return value
    * Functions with argument and return value
    * Functions with argument and multiple return values
    * Function that convert lower case letters to upper case
    * Factorial using recursion.
    * Perform String Operations using Switch Case
    * Largest among a set of numbers using command line argument
* **Structures and Union:**
    * Structure that describes a hotel (name, address, grade, avg room rent, number of rooms) Perform some operations (list of hotels of a given grade etc.)
    * Using Pointers in Structures.
    * Cricket team details using Union.
* **Pointers:**
    * Evaluation of Pointer expressions
    * Function to exchange two pointer values
    * Reverse a string using pointers
    * Insertion, deletion, and searching in an array
