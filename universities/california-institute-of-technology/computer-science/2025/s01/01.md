# CS1: Introduction to Computer Programming (Fall 2025)

## Course Objectives

CS1 is designed to be accessible to students interested in any option, regardless of prior experience. The course is structured around four core values:

1. **CS and programming are for everyone!** - Designed to be accessible to students from any discipline, regardless of prior programming experience.

2. **Projects cover diverse disciplines!** - Weekly projects are themed around different fields (physics, chemistry, engineering, math) to provide relevance across disciplines.

3. **CS1 material is sequenced to set you up for success!** - Three modules: Reading and Modifying Python code, Using Python to Get Things Done, and Another Programming Language and Preparation for Future CS Courses.

4. **CS1 is not an "easy" course, but we want you to succeed!** - Extensive office hours (more than twenty people-hours) and help resources ensure student success.

## Course Content

### Module 0: Reading and Modifying Python Code
* Working with existing codebases (most code written won't be from scratch)
* Navigation and understanding of existing Python code
* Modifying existing code for research applications

### Module 1: Using Python to Get Things Done
* Creating mental models of what Python is doing
* Effective debugging and writing small programs from scratch
* Core Python programming concepts and structures

### Module 2: Another Programming Language and Preparation for Future CS Courses
* Introduction to Java programming language
* Comparison with Python
* Preparation for future CS courses and research applications
* Understanding features needed for C++, C, Rust, and Julia

## Course Schedule (Fall 2025)

### Key Topics Covered:
* **Variables, Types, and Functions** - Basic Python syntax and function definition
* **Lists, Iteration, and Selection** - Lists, for loops, if statements
* **Functions and Return Values** - Writing functions and handling return values
* **While Loops** - Indefinite loops and common loop patterns
* **Dictionaries** - Storing mappings and key-value pairs
* **Exceptions** - Error handling in Python
* **Objects and Classes** - Object-oriented programming concepts
* **Recursion** - Recursive programming techniques

### Major Projects:
* **project01 (Battleship, part 1)** - Fundamental Python concepts with emphasis on conditionals and lists
* **project02** - Advanced Python programming
* **project03** - Working with hardware (Trinkey device)

### Assessments:
* **In-Class Quiz** - Week 10 (Wednesday, October 22)
* **In-Class Midterm** - Week 22 (Wednesday, November 19)
* **In-Class Final** - Week 26 (Friday, November 28)

## Assessment Methods

### Formative Assessments (Diagnostics)
* In-class exercises during lectures
* Multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and explanation questions
* Collaborative work during lecture time
* Second attempt opportunities outside class
* Drop two lowest diagnostic scores

### Summative Assessments
* **Written Quiz** - 40% minimum to pass
* **Written Midterm** - 60% minimum to pass
* **Written Final** - 60% minimum to pass
* Must pass at least 2 of the 3 assessments

### Projects
* Weekly themed projects across different disciplines
* Must complete every DUE and earn at least 50% on each project
* Project average counts toward final grade

### Grading Formula
Shadow Grade = 0.5 × (best two of quiz, midterm, final) + 0.4 × (Project Average) + 0.1 × (Diagnostic Average)
