# CS 24: Introduction to Computing Systems (Fall 2025)

## Course Objectives

CS 24 provides a basic introduction to computer systems, including hardware-software interface, computer architecture, and operating systems. The course emphasizes computer system abstractions and the hardware and software techniques necessary to support them.

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

* Differentiate between how Java and C code run on modern machines (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyze)
* Translate between high-level and low-level programming languages (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
* Defend trade-offs between efficiency, security, readability, and performance in your programs (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Evaluate)
* Explain the mechanisms modern systems use to protect, manage, and virtualize memory (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyze)
* Describe how modern computers give the illusion of running multiple things at once (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)
* Design a concurrent program which does not have any race conditions (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Create)

## Course Content

### Module 1: Computing Systems Perspectives and Memory
* Perspectives on computing systems
  - What is this course about?
  - How do computers represent information?
  - Hexadecimal and number bases
* Memory abstractions
  - What does an abstraction for memory look like?
  - Memory representation and organization
  - Fixed-width integers and negative number representation

### Module 2: ARM64 Assembly Language
* ARM64 introduction
  - What is ARM64 and why should I care about assembly?
  - Understanding basic assembly programs and instructions
  - mov and other basic instructions
* ARM64 conditionals and control flow
  - How does branching work in ARM64?
  - What is a label?
  - Translating if statements into assembly

### Module 3: ARM64 Procedures and Stack Management
* ARM64 procedures
  - How do function calls and returns work?
  - What is 'the stack' really?
  - More ARM64 procedures and recursion
* Recursive procedures
  - How does recursion work using the stack?
  - ARM64 recursive procedures

### Module 4: Security and Buffer Overflows
* Security concepts
  - What happens if we read past the end of a buffer?
  - How can we exploit buffer overflows?
  - Security mechanisms in modern systems

### Module 5: System Abstractions and Virtualization
* Virtualization techniques
  - Memory virtualization
  - Processing virtualization
  - Communication virtualization
* Dynamic resource management
  - Common-case optimization
  - Isolation and naming
  - System protection mechanisms

## Assessment Methods

### Programming Projects
* **pretest (disk)** - Orientation to CS 24, representation, number bases, and pointer review
* **project01 (jvm)** - Building a simplified Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to process bytecode and execute Java programs on a custom virtual machine

### Examinations
* **Quiz** - Written in-person assessment during lecture time
* **Midterm** - Written in-person assessment during lecture time
* **Final Exam** - Cumulative written exam during final exam period
* Approximately 50% of questions pulled directly from in-class exercises

## Prerequisites
* CS 2: Introduction to Programming Methods
* CS 3: Additional programming course
