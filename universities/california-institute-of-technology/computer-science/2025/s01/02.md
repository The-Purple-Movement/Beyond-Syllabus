# CS 2: Introduction to Programming Methods (Winter 2025)

## Course Objectives

This course is intended as a continuation of CS 1. We focus on abstraction in programmingâ€”both in design of programs and data storage. We discuss and implement fundamental data structures and algorithms via a series of labs and projects. We will grade on correctness and efficiency of our programs.

* Master Java programming language and object-oriented programming concepts (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
* Design and implement fundamental data structures from scratch (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
* Analyze algorithmic efficiency using asymptotic analysis (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyze)
* Apply recursive backtracking and other algorithmic techniques (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
* Debug and test programs using professional development tools (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
