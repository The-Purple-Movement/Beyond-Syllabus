# CS402: Algorithms

## Prerequisite Course / Knowledge
* [cite_start]Data Structures in under graduate level, discrete mathematical structures, knowledge of sorting algorithms and basic search strategies[cite: 1885].

## Course Objectives
* [cite_start]CO-1: Assess the inherent structure/hardness of a problem (Evaluate)[cite: 1888].
* [cite_start]CO-2: Select an appropriate strategy to solve a problem (Understand)[cite: 1889].
* CO-3: Design an algorithm that suits the time complexity requirements of the problem. (Create) [cite_start][cite: 1890].
* CO-4: Estimate the time and space complexities of an algorithm along with the necessary mathematical proofs when necessary. (Evaluate) [cite_start][cite: 1891, 1892].
