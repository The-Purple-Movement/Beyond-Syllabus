## Course Objectives
* [cite_start]Apply predicate and propositional logic to represent and solve problems[cite: 3463].
* [cite_start]Discuss various ways of simplification and apply the same on minimizing logical circuits[cite: 3464].
* [cite_start]Using principle of recursion, be able to frame a real-world situation as a recurrence relation and solve[cite: 3465].
* [cite_start]Describe counting principles[cite: 3466].
* [cite_start]Apply counting principles in real world scenarios[cite: 3467].
* [cite_start]Describe graphs and trees techniques[cite: 3468].
