# CA412: Programming Methodology 

## Course Objectives
* [cite_start]Create specification from problem requirements by asking questions to disambiguate the requirement Statement[cite: 3504].
* [cite_start]Design the solution from specification of a problem and write pseudo code of the algorithm[cite: 3505].
* [cite_start]Analyze algorithms by tracing algorithms with test cases[cite: 3506].
* [cite_start]Develop C programs using all supported features and compile them using Makefile[cite: 3507].
* [cite_start]Analyze programs using debugging tools[cite: 3508].

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction to Problem Solving
* Problems and problem instances; [cite_start]Informal approach to program design: generalisation, special cases, and algorithms, breaking down a problem into functions, input and output[cite: 3513].

### Module 2: Introduction to the 'C' Programming Language
* [cite_start]Program structure; main () function; unnamed and named blocks; basic data types, variables, declaration and definition; initialisation and assignment[cite: 3515].
* [cite_start]Arithmetic operators and precedence; implicit and explicit type conversions; arrays; boolean variables and logical operators[cite: 3516].

### Module 3: Control Structures
* [cite_start]Branching and iteration; functions and parameters; break (), return () and exit () functions; local and global variables; function prototypes[cite: 3518].

### Module 4: Pointer Variables and Dynamic Structures
* [cite_start]Static and dynamic (run-time) memory structures; static variables; breaking a program across multiple files; creating and linking libraries[cite: 3520].

### Module 5: Detecting and Correcting Common Errors
* [cite_start]Debugging and debuggers; documenting programs; good programming practices; programming exercise (writing a program of at least 200 lines split across multiple files)[cite: 3522].

## Lab Component (Associated with CA415)
* Practical exercises covering Modules 1-5, focusing on C programming, algorithm implementation, debugging, and using Makefiles.
