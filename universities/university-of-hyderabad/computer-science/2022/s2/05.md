# CS472: Cloud Computing

## Prerequisite Course / Knowledge
* [cite_start]Knowledge of Distributed Computing, Networks, Java/C++/Python/C#/node.js and Unix/Linux/Windows [cite: 1342-1343].

## Course Objectives
* [cite_start]CO1: Describe the fundamentals of Service Oriented Architecture and its implementations (Understand)[cite: 1346].
* [cite_start]CO2: Analyze a practical application, identify the issues and apply suitable techniques studied in the course effectively (Analyze)[cite: 1347].
* [cite_start]CO3: Develop skill to learn how to write Web Services using SOAP and REST way (Create) [cite: 1348-1349].
* [cite_start]CO4: Outline the theory behind the Virtualization of x86 family of processors (Understand)[cite: 1349].
* [cite_start]CO5: Apply the system virtualization solutions for creating Virtual Machine and their management (Apply)[cite: 1350].
* [cite_start]CO6: Assess the proposed solutions (REST/SOAP), architecture using different parameters for a given problem (Evaluate)[cite: 1352]. *(Note: PDF incorrectly lists CO5 twice, assuming the second is CO6 based on context)*
* [cite_start]CO7: Describe the subtle issue in handling the security in Clouds (Understand)[cite: 1353].
* [cite_start]CO8: Develop skill to learn how to write Cloud Services/deploy using PaaS solutions like (Aneka & Heroku) (Create)[cite: 1354].
