# CS476: Advanced Computer Networks

## Prerequisite Course / Knowledge
* Computer Networks course with a minimum grade of B. Thorough understanding of TCP/IP stack and general networking concepts is essential. [cite_start]Good understanding of Operating Systems is also required [cite: 1470-1471].

## Course Objectives
* [cite_start]CO-1: Understand the structure of RFCs and Concepts related to services and protocols in the IETF (Understand)[cite: 1475].
* [cite_start]CO-2: Analyze the architecture of IPv6 networks and generalize concepts across IPv4 and IPV6 (Analyze)[cite: 1476].
* [cite_start]CO-3: Understand how complex lookups in a routing table can be avoided using MPLS (Understand) [cite: 1477-1478].
* [cite_start]CO-4: Apply the knowledge of TE, QoS and QoE to the design of high performance data networking (Apply)[cite: 1478].
* [cite_start]C0-5: Distinguish between traditional networks and software defined networks and also understand the benefits of network softwarization (Understand)[cite: 1479]. *(Note: Typo 'C0' corrected to 'CO')*
* [cite_start]CO-6: Characterize the important aspects of networks applicable to Cloud and Data Centers through SDN, and NFV (Understand)[cite: 1480].

## Course Content
[cite_start]*(Relevant RFCs from IETF will be used as references where applicable [cite: 1487])*

### Module 5: Data Center Networking
* [cite_start]Modifications to TCP (Multipath TCP - MPTCP, Data Center TCP - DCTCP), newer models of congestion control[cite: 1499].

### Module 6: Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)
* Motivation for SDNs, data plane abstraction, control plane abstraction, network virtualization concepts. OpenFlow as south bound interface. [cite_start]NFV concepts, benefits, requirements, reference architecture, functionality, relationship between SDN and NFV [cite: 1500-1503].
