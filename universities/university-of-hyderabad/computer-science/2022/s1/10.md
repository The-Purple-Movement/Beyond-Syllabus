# CS428: Graph Theory

## Prerequisite Course / Knowledge
* [cite_start]It is expected that the students must have done discrete mathematics course[cite: 1163].

## Course Objectives
* [cite_start]CO1: Describe the basic concepts of graphs (Understand)[cite: 1166].
* [cite_start]CO3: Discuss the proofs of some properties of graphs (Understand)[cite: 1167]. *(Note: CO2 seems missing in the PDF)*
* [cite_start]CO4: Model real world problems using graph theory (Analyze)[cite: 1168].
* CO5: Formulate and prove central theorems about trees, connectivity, planar graphs, coloring and matching. (Create) [cite_start][cite: 1169-1170].
* [cite_start]CO6: Create basic algorithms of graphs (Create)[cite: 1171].

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction and Basic Concepts
* Introduction to undirected/directed graphs, applications, basic definitions (graphic sequence, subgraph, paths, walks, cycles, Euler tour, Hamiltonian cycle, isomorphism).
* [cite_start]Different kinds of graphs: bipartite, complete, regular graphs, etc[cite: 1177].

### Module 2: Trees
* [cite_start]Properties of trees, centres, enumerating trees, fundamental circuits, spanning trees[cite: 1179].

### Module 3: Graph Connectivity
* Vertex and edge connectivity, bi-connected components. [cite_start]Cut vertex and cut sets[cite: 1181].

### Module 4: Planarity and Graph Coloring
* Euler formula for planar graphs, dual graphs, Kuratowski theorem.
* [cite_start]Vertex coloring, chromatic number, chromatic polynomial, coloring planar graphs: 5-coloring and 4-coloring planar graphs[cite: 1183].

### Module 5: Other Topics
* Matching, maximum matchings, Halls matching condition, min-max theorem, maximum bipartite matching.
* [cite_start]Network flows, max flow min-cut theorem[cite: 1185].
