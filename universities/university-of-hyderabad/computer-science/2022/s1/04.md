# CS421: Introduction to Data Compression

## Prerequisite Course / Knowledge
* [cite_start]Students are expected to have completed Computer Algorithms, must have done Basic Calculus course, and has basic understanding of Probability[cite: 939].

## Course Objectives
* [cite_start]CO-1: Test whether a code is uniquely decodable or not (Analyze)[cite: 942].
* [cite_start]CO-2: Compare codes using measures of performance (Evaluate)[cite: 942].
* [cite_start]CO-3: Design Loss Less compression codes such as Huffman code, Non-binary Huffman code, Extended Huffman code, Adaptive Huffman code, Golomb code, Tunstall code, Arithmetic code, Lempel Ziv (LZ77, LZ78, LZW) codes, etc. (Create)[cite: 943].
* CO-4: Explain the advantages of an Arithmetic code over an extended Huffman code. (Understand) [cite_start][cite: 944-945].
* CO-5: Evaluate the entropy of a source given its probability model, determine whether a given code is optimum code or not, determine bounds on the average length of an optimum code. (Evaluate) [cite_start][cite: 945-946].
