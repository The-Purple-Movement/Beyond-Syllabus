# CST302: Compiler Design

## Course Objectives
* To introduce phases and principles of compiler construction.
* To develop ability to design lexical, syntax, and semantic analyzers.
* To impart knowledge of intermediate code generation, optimization, and code generation.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Describe phases of compilation, compiler writing tools, lexical analysis.
* **CO2:** Apply syntax analysis with top-down/bottom-up parsing.
* **CO3:** Model and implement syntax-directed translation, intermediate code.
* **CO4:** Analyze storage allocation and run-time environments.
* **CO5:** Apply code optimization and generation techniques.

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction and Lexical Analysis
* Compiler phases, compilation process, bootstrapping, lexical analysis, input buffering, token recognition.

### Module 2: Syntax Analysis
* Syntax error handling, parsing approaches (recursive descent, predictive), context-free grammar, parse tree, left recursion, left factoring, LL(1).

### Module 3: Bottom-Up Parsing
* Shift-reduce parsing, operator precedence parsing, LR parsing, SLR, LALR, canonical LR tables.

### Module 4: Syntax Directed Translation and Intermediate Code Generation
* Syntax directed definitions (S/L-attributed), run-time environments, intermediate representations, three-address code, quadruples, triples.

### Module 5: Code Optimization and Generation
* Optimization sources, local/global optimizations, target languages, simple code generator.
