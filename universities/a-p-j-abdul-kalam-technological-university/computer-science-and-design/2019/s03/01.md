# MAT203: Discrete Mathematical Structures

## Course Objectives
* To introduce concepts fundamental to discrete mathematics.
* To develop understanding of logic, set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory.
* To prepare students for abstraction and mathematical reasoning in CS.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Apply propositional and predicate logic for formal reasoning (Apply).
* **CO2:** Solve problems using combinatorial methods (Apply).
* **CO3:** Use set theory and relations for mathematical abstraction (Understand, Apply).
