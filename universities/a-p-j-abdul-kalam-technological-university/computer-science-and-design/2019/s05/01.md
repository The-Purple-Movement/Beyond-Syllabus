# CST301: Formal Languages and Automata Theory

## Course Objectives
* To introduce concepts of formal languages, automata, and grammars.
* To enable design and analysis of finite, pushdown, and Turing automata.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Define basic concepts of automata, languages, and grammars.
* **CO2:** Construct and analyze finite automata, regular languages.
* **CO3:** Apply context-free grammars and pushdown automata.
* **CO4:** Understand Turing machines and notions of computability.
* **CO5:** Analyze applications and limits of the theory.
