# CXT402: Advanced Computer Graphics

## Course Objectives
* To introduce advanced concepts for 3D modeling, display methods, animation, color models, and rendering.
* To equip students for design and development of visual, interactive systems.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Explain 3D display and representation methods (Understand).
* **CO2:** Apply 3D transformations, projections and viewing pipelines (Apply).
* **CO3:** Analyze and implement illumination, shading, and rendering techniques (Analyze).
* **CO4:** Evaluate color models and their applications in graphics (Apply).
* **CO5:** Develop animation sequences for digital systems (Apply).

## Course Content

### Module 1: 3D Object Representations
* 3D display methods, polygon surfaces, quadric surfaces, super quadrics, spline representations (Bezier curves), sweep representation, octrees.

### Module 2: 3D Transformations and Viewing
* 3D transformation basics, reflection, shear, composite transformations, viewing pipeline, coordinate transformations, projections, view volumes.

### Module 3: Illumination Models
* Light sources, basic models, polygon rendering (Constant-Intensity, Gouraud/Phong shading, ray tracing).

### Module 4: Color Models and Applications
* Light properties, color models (RGB, HSV, HLS, YIQ, CMY), conversions, chromaticity diagrams.

### Module 5: Computer Animation
* Animation sequence design, raster/keyframe animation, motion specification, morphing.
