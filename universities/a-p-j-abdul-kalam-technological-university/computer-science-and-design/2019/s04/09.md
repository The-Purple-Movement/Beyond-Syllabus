# CSL204: Operating Systems Lab

## Course Objectives
* To impart practical knowledge of OS interfaces, system calls, and algorithms.
* To enhance hands-on abilities in process and memory management.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO1:** Use basic Linux commands and scripting (Apply).
* **CO2:** Implement OS system calls in programs (Apply).
* **CO3:** Design and test scheduling, memory, and file management algorithms (Apply, Analyze).

## Course Content

* Linux commands and shell scripting.
* C programs for system calls: fork, exec, file operations.
* Inter-process communication methods: Shared memory, semaphores.
* Implement: CPU scheduling (RR, SJF, FCFS, Priority), memory allocation (First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit), page replacement (FIFO, LRU, LFU), deadlock avoidance (banker's), file and disk management strategies.
