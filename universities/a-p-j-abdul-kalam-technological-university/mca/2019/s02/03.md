# RLMCA106: Operating Systems

## Course Objectives

- To introduce you to Operating Systems concepts, to make you a more effective programmer
- To design and implement operating systems
- To cover important concepts like process management, memory management, I/O
  management, file system management and protection.

### Module - 1 

-Introduction Basic concepts – user view & system view –
Computer System organization - OS structure – batch
processing - multiprogramming - time sharing - OS
operations. Distributed systems - Multiprocessor system -
real time - embedded systems
-Operating system services – User OS interface, System calls –
types, System programs, OS structure – simple – layered.

### Module - 2 

-Process management – process concept – states – PCB –
threads introduction – process scheduling – queues –
schedulers – long, short & medium – context switch.
Operations on processes – process creation and termination.
Process scheduling – pre-emptive and non-pre-emptive –
scheduling criteria – scheduling algorithms – different types
algorithm evaluation - deterministic modelling only. 

### Module - 3

-Inter process communication – shared memory – message
passing.
Process Co-ordination - Synchronization - the critical
section problem – Petersons solution – Synchronization
hardware – Semaphores – usage and implementation – the
bounded buffer problem

### Module - 4

-Dead locks – system model & characterization – methods
for handling deadlocks - prevention - avoidance - bankers
algorithm - detection - Recovery from dead lock.

Memory management - Preliminaries – address binding – logical
and physical address space - Swapping - Contiguous memory
allocation – fragmentation - paging – with TLB – protection –
hierarchical page table structure – segmentation hardware

### Module - 5

-Virtual memory concepts - demand paging - page
replacement – different types – frame allocation –
algorithms – thrashing.
Secondary storage structure – Overview – disk structure - disk
scheduling - FCFS, SST, CSCAN - selecting a disk scheduling
algorithm.

### Module - 6

-Storage management - File concepts – attributes –
operations – types – structure – access methods. Directory
and disc structure –overview – directory schemes – single
level – two level – tree structured – acyclic and general
graph directories. File system mounting.
Protection – types of access – access control.
-File system – structure and implementation. Directory
implementation – File allocation methods – Free space
management using link list only
