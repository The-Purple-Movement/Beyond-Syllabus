# RLMCA232: System Design Lab  

## Course Objectives

- To Introduce Shell Scripting
- To sensitize the need for Version control
- To do network programming using Socket Programs


## Exercises

### Administration Level
Introduction to Shell scripting – Experiment with shell scripts mainly for administrative tasks like
user creation in bulk, changing file permissions recursively, creating files in bulk, deleting folders and sub folders etc…
1.Commands
1.echo, read
2.more, less
3.man
4.chmod, chown
5.cd, mkdir, pwd, ls, find
6.cat, mv, cp, rm
7.wc, cut, paste
8.head, tail, grep, expr
9.Redirections & Piping
10.useradd, usermod, userdel, passwd
11.tar
2.Scripting
  1.Environment variables
  2.If statement
  3.For statement
  4.While statement
3.Remote access
  1.ssh, scp, ssh-keygen, ssh-copy-id
  2.Scheduling Using cron and at 

### GIT

1.git init - Initializing an empty git repository
git init --bare
2.git status - Knowing the status of your repository
3.git add <artifact> Staging/Adding artifacts(files) to repository
{3.1 git status}*
4.git commit -m "Message for the commit" - Details on how to commit changes to the local
repository
5.git add <pattern> - Bulk adding/staging artifacts to repository
{5.1 git commit -m "Commit the changes"}*
6.git log - Git Activity logs
7.git remote add <origin_name> <remote repository URL> - Attaching a remote repository
<remote repository URL> - username@127.0.0.1:/path/to/repository
8.git push -u <origin_name> <branch> (git push -u origin master) -Pushing to the master
9.it pull origin master - Pulling from a master
10.git diff options
11.resetting a staged/added file.
12.git checkout
13.git branch <branch_name> - Creating the branches
14.git checkout <branch_name> - switching between branches
15.git rm 'pattern' - removing the files/artifacts
{15.1 commit to the branch}*
{15.2 Switch back to the master}*
16.git merge <branch_name> - Merging the contents.
17.git branch -d <branch_name> - Removing a branch
18.git push - Syncing with the remote repository
19.git stash - Park your changes in directory.
20.git stash apply - Applying the changes back (git stash options)
21.git rebase - Reapply commits on top of another base tip
* Steps that are repeated for completing the exercise
Students should be encouraged to do all the subsequent experiments in a GIT repository.

### Network Programming (Java/C)

1. Implement Bidirectional Client-Server communication using TCP.
2. Implement Echo Server using TCP
3. Implement Chat Server using UDP.
