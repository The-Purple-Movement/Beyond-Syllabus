# 24-360-0101: ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY

## Course Objectives
1. Understand Foundations of Ecology
2. Explore Population Dynamics
3. Examine Community Dynamics
4. Investigate Ecosystem Functioning
5. Apply Ecology to Conservation

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Understand the historical development and fundamental concepts of ecology.
* **CO 2:** To Analyze population characteristics and dynamics, to assess the roles of species in community ecology and population balance.
* **CO 3:** To Evaluate the processes of succession, To understand their structure, stability, and resilience.
* **CO 4:** To Examine energy flows, nutrient cycling, and landscape connectivity, to assess ecosystem functioning and health.
* **CO 5:** Apply principles of conservation biology to analyze threats to biodiversity, evaluate ecosystem services, and implement restoration.
